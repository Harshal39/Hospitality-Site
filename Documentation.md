I was provided with  a website ```https://www.kingsukhguesthouse.com/``` and was instructed to make its clone.\
I decided to choose ReactJS as a techstack to build this website.

First of all I explored the website found some issues.\
Along with the issues I have analysed all the colors used in website and made _CSS Custom Attributes_ for it.\
CSS custom properties allow you to store specific values for reuse throughout your CSS document.\

## Codebase setup
Command:- ```npx create-react-app project-name``` was used which made a folder along with required dependencies and scripts in package.json file.\
_React_, _React-DOM_ and _React-Scripts_ were installed in this CRA template.\
Further installed _framer motion_ for animation effects in web app.\
Command:- ```npm install framer-motion```\
Separate Images folder was made in src-->components-->images were images required for website are stored.\
